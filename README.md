A short description about me 
Hi, i'm @AvogatoWizardWhisker, a digital marketer enthusiast and computer aficionado, I'm on a quest to conquer the realms of C#, HTML, and CSS. With a moniker that conjures images of a mystical feline wielding a wand in one paw and a ripe avocado in the other, he navigates the digital jungle with the precision of a coder and the creativity of a marketer. As for lions, did you know that a lion's roar can be so thunderous it can be heard up to 8.04672 kilometers away? Imagine if they had social media â€“ their posts would literally go viral with every roar! <sub></sub>
