# AboutMe
<h1>AvogatoWizardWishker</h1>
<p>Hi, i'm @AvogatoWizardWhisker, a digital marketer enthusiast and computer aficionado, I'm on a quest to conquer the realms of C#, HTML, and CSS. With a moniker that conjures images of a mystical feline wielding a wand in one paw and a ripe avocado in the other, he navigates the digital jungle with the kindergarten level of a coder and the skills of a marketer. As for lions, did you know that a lion's roar can be so thunderous it can be heard up to 8.04672 kilometers away? Imagine if they had social media â€“ their posts would literally go viral with every roar! </p>
<h2>What i'm currently learning</h2>

With its crystal-clear syntax and treasure trove of features, C# makes sure your first steps into coding are as smooth as a well-compiled program. It's like finding a friendly guide in the vast forest of programming languages, one that not only understands your beginner's struggles but also cheers you on with every line of code you write correctly.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo.svg" width=50 height=50 alt="HTML 5 logo"> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the skeleton of all web pages. It's like the digital version of Lego blocks, where each piece is a tag, and together they build the structure of your online creations. Imagine if your browser was a chef; HTML would be the recipe it follows to cook up the website you see on your screen. It's not the fanciest language out there, but without it, the web would be as bland as a pizza without cheese!</p>
  <p><img src="https://jaspreetchahal.org/images/css3.svg" width=50 height=50> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is like the fashion guru of the web world. It's the tool that gives websites their sparkle and pizzazz, turning dull, plain text into a visual fiesta. Imagine if you could tell your clothes to change color based on the weather or the time of dayâ€”that's CSS for websites. It lets web designers create a look that can react to a user's actions, making the internet not just a place to get information, but a dynamic space to experience. So next time a website catches your eye, tip your hat to CSS, the silent stylist behind the screen!</p>
